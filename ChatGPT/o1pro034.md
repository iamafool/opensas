Below is an **example** of a function that copies all the major fields from one `SasDoc` to another **without** overwriting the destination¡¯s `name`. The code also discusses **what** is ¡°enough¡± in terms of a **shallow** versus **deep** copy in the context of C++ vectors and `flyweight_string`:

## 1. Outline of the Copy Function

```cpp
#include "sasdoc.h"
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy, etc.

namespace sass {

/**
 * Copies all the fields from `src` into `dest` except the `dest->name`.
 * This includes var_count, obs_count, var_names, var_types, var_labels,
 * var_formats, var_length, var_display_length, var_decimals, and values.
 *
 * If `src` is null or `dest` is null, does nothing.
 */
void copySasDocExceptName(const SasDoc* src, SasDoc* dest) {
    if (!src || !dest) {
        return;
    }

    // We do NOT overwrite `dest->name`.
    // We DO copy everything else:
    dest->creation_time      = src->creation_time;
    dest->modified_time      = src->modified_time;
    dest->file_format_version= src->file_format_version;
    dest->compression        = src->compression;
    dest->endianness         = src->endianness;
    // do not copy name:
    // dest->name = src->name; // <--- intentionally omitted
    dest->file_label         = src->file_label;
    dest->file_info          = src->file_info;
    dest->file_encoding      = src->file_encoding;
    dest->is64bit            = src->is64bit;
    dest->release            = src->release;
    dest->host               = src->host;
    dest->page_size          = src->page_size;
    dest->page_count         = src->page_count;
    dest->row_length         = src->row_length;
    dest->file_size          = src->file_size;
    dest->obs_count          = src->obs_count;
    dest->var_count          = src->var_count;

    // Copy the vectors:
    dest->var_names          = src->var_names;
    dest->var_labels         = src->var_labels;
    dest->var_formats        = src->var_formats;
    dest->var_types          = src->var_types;
    dest->var_length         = src->var_length;
    dest->var_display_length = src->var_display_length;
    dest->var_decimals       = src->var_decimals;

    // Copy the main `values` vector:
    // This is typically a "shallow" copy in terms of the vector data,
    // but each element is a variant<flyweight_string, double>.
    // In C++, copying a std::vector<Cell> *does* copy all elements. That
    // is effectively a ¡°deep copy¡± of the vector memory. However, the
    // `flyweight_string` inside might share the underlying string data
    // with the source. That is usually OK, unless you want total isolation.
    dest->values             = src->values;

    // Copy bitsets:
    dest->obs_flag           = src->obs_flag;
    dest->or_flag            = src->or_flag;
    dest->obs_library_filter = src->obs_library_filter;
    dest->var_flag           = src->var_flag;

    // Copy parseValue, mapFormat, etc.
    dest->parseValue         = src->parseValue;
    dest->mapFormat          = src->mapFormat;
}

} // namespace sass
```

**Key Points**:

1. We **do not** copy `dest->name`, so the caller can preserve the destination dataset¡¯s name.  
2. Everything else is **assigned** via normal C++ container assignment.  
3. `std::vector::operator=()` does a *deep copy of elements* (i.e. copies each `Cell`). But note that each `Cell` might store a `flyweight_string`, which is reference-counted inside the Boost Flyweight mechanism. This is usually **fine**, because sharing the underlying string data is **expected** to be ¡°safe¡± in a flyweight context.

---

## 2. Is a ¡°Shadow Copy¡± Enough?

In C++, when you do `dest->values = src->values;`, you get a **new** `std::vector<Cell>` in the destination. The vector itself has new memory for its elements. Each element (`Cell`) is copied. If the `Cell` is holding `flyweight_string`, that means it still *refers to the same underlying string data* in the Flyweight repository. Typically, **this is fine** because:

- Flyweight strings are reference-counted or otherwise cached.  
- You rarely need a fully *independent* string copy (like `std::string` would do) because two `flyweight_string`s can *safely* share the data.  

Hence, in most SAS-like interpreters, it is **enough** to do the ¡°normal C++ assignment¡± to copy over the vectors. This is typically considered a ¡°deep¡± copy of the container but a *¡°shallow¡± reference copy* at the string-data level. That is nearly always acceptable.

> If you truly wanted to break *all* references to the old doc¡¯s data, you¡¯d need a custom approach that re©\creates each string. That defeats the purpose of `flyweight_string` though. Usually you do **not** want to do that.

---

## 3. Additional Considerations

1. **Performance**: Copying large `values` can be expensive if you have millions of rows. But usually in a SAS-like interpreter, it¡¯s acceptable overhead (especially if you want a separate, stable new dataset).  
2. **SASDoc vs. Dataset**: 
   - If you also store `Dataset::rows`, you might want to copy them or leave them cleared. Typically `SasDoc` is used *instead of* the `rows` approach.  
3. **Partial Column Copy**: If you only needed certain columns, you could do a more specialized approach (like a ¡°projection¡±). But here, we are duplicating the entire structure.  
4. **Renaming**: If you want to rename some variables in the destination, do it *after* copying or omit it as needed.  

Overall, for a typical ¡°**copy everything except the name**¡± scenario, the above function is **sufficient**. You can think of it as ¡°shallow¡± at the string level, but that is standard C++ behavior and is typically *¡°deep enough¡±* for most uses.
