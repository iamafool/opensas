Thought about PEGTL vs Boost Spirit for a couple of seconds
PEGTL (Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library) and Boost.Spirit are both C++ template libraries designed to help you write parsers directly in C++. While they share some goals, such as allowing you to define grammar rules in C++ code rather than using external parser generators, they differ in philosophy, complexity, and style.

Grammar Formalism and Style
PEGTL:

Uses Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) as its formalism. PEGs provide a clear, unambiguous way to define languages, avoiding many ambiguities that can arise with context-free grammars.
The grammar is defined through a series of template class specializations and typedefs, closely mimicking PEG syntax within C++ templates.
Grammars tend to be relatively easy to read and reason about, as PEG rules directly represent deterministic parsing behavior.
Boost.Spirit:

Based on an EBNF-like DSL embedded in C++ through operator overloading.
Lets you write grammars in a style that is somewhat closer to a BNF notation, but often heavily utilizes template metaprogramming, operator overloading, and expression templates.
The grammar can look elegant and concise, but can also become complex and harder to debug if it gets large or if the rules become intricate.
Complexity and Learning Curve
PEGTL:

Generally considered simpler and more direct.
The library is smaller, and because PEGs are inherently deterministic, it¡¯s straightforward to understand how the parser will behave.
Error messages may still be template-heavy, but the library¡¯s design tends to lead to clearer rules and easier debugging compared to Spirit.
Good for incremental, test-driven development of parsers: you can define simple rules and build up complexity over time.
Boost.Spirit:

A more mature and older project with a longer history, extensive documentation, and many examples.
However, Spirit¡¯s template-heavy code can lead to very complex compiler errors if something goes wrong.
The operator-based DSL can be hard to debug and maintain for large grammars or less experienced C++ developers.
Steeper learning curve if you want to become proficient, especially for nontrivial grammars.
Performance and Efficiency
Both libraries generate parsers at compile time, which can yield high-performance code without a separate runtime parsing engine. The differences typically come down to implementation details and the complexity of the grammar:

PEGTL: The deterministic nature of PEGs often translates to straightforward parsing logic and good performance.
Boost.Spirit: Also known for efficiency once compiled, but the complexity of expression templates and backtracking rules in more complex grammars can, in some cases, impact performance.
Error Handling and Diagnostics
PEGTL:

Emphasizes clear rule composition, which can make it easier to pinpoint where a parsing error arises in your grammar.
Has features for generating human-readable error messages and controlling error handling.
Boost.Spirit:

Provides debugging facilities, but due to the more complex template structures and operator overloading, diagnosing grammar-related errors can be trickier.
Compile-time error messages in Spirit can be intimidating due to deeply nested template instantiations.
Ecosystem and Community
PEGTL:

A newer library compared to Spirit, with a growing community.
Simpler design makes it appealing for modern C++ projects.
Boost.Spirit:

Part of Boost, a well-established and widely used collection of libraries.
Large user base, a lot of existing support and legacy code using Spirit.
Extensive documentation and examples, but also more ¡°historical baggage¡± and complexity.
Which to Choose?
Choose PEGTL if:
You prefer the clearer semantics of PEGs.
You want a simpler, more modern approach.
You value easier maintenance and incremental development of your grammar.
Choose Boost.Spirit if:
You need the advanced features and rich ecosystem of Boost.
You have prior experience with Spirit or a codebase that already uses it.
You prefer EBNF-like DSL and are comfortable dealing with complex templates and error messages.
In summary:
PEGTL provides a more straightforward, modern, and deterministic parsing approach with PEGs, leading to simpler maintenance and debugging. Boost.Spirit is more mature, widely used, and feature-rich but can be more complex to learn and maintain. The choice depends on your project requirements, personal preference, and comfort level with advanced C++ template metaprogramming.
