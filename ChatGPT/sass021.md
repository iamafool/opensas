No. Let me clarify. For the interactive mode, we type in the codes line by line. But right now, if I only type in "data", there will be an error.

Thought for a few seconds
In a REPL-like (interactive) environment, SAS doesn't typically produce an immediate error if a statement is incomplete. Instead, it waits until a statement-terminating character (`;`), or a `run;` step boundary, is encountered to compile and execute the code. If the user just typed `data` and hit enter, SAS would still be "waiting" for more input rather than erroring out.

**How to Implement This Behavior:**

1. **Accumulate Input Until a Statement Is Complete:**
   Instead of trying to parse each line immediately and independently, accumulate the lines into a buffer. When the user hits Enter, check if the buffer now contains at least one complete statement (e.g., ended by a semicolon).

   - If the buffer does not yet contain a complete statement, prompt the user again and append the next line.
   - Only when a complete statement (or set of statements) is formed, attempt to parse and execute it.
   - If parsing fails, print the error. If it succeeds, clear the buffer of the consumed statements and continue.

2. **Determining "Complete" Statements:**
   Since SAS statements generally end in a semicolon, one heuristic is to check if there¡¯s at least one semicolon outside of quotes that indicates the end of a statement. Another boundary is `run;`, which often signals the end of a data step or proc block.  
   
   A simple approach:
   - Each time you read a new line, append it (with a newline) to a `codeBuffer` string.
   - Check if `codeBuffer` contains at least one `';'` that finalizes a statement or a `run;`.
   - If not, ask for more input.
   - If yes, attempt to parse what you have so far. You might parse the entire buffer or just up to the next terminating `;` or `run;`.

3. **Example Pseudocode:**
   ```cpp
   std::string codeBuffer;
   while (true) {
       std::cout << "SAS> ";
       std::string line;
       if (!std::getline(std::cin, line)) {
           // End of input (Ctrl+D / Ctrl+Z)
           break;
       }

       // If user enters "quit" or "exit"
       if (line == "quit" || line == "exit") {
           break;
       }

       codeBuffer += line + "\n";

       // Check if we have a complete statement
       // This could be as simple as checking for a semicolon:
       // For a more robust check, consider actually tokenizing and checking syntax.
       if (codeBuffer.find(';') != std::string::npos) {
           // We have at least one complete statement
           // Attempt to parse the buffer
           bool success = parseAndExecuteSasCode(codeBuffer); // Your parsing function
           if (!success) {
               std::cerr << "Error parsing code.\n";
           }

           // On success or failure, clear or adjust the buffer.
           // If you parse everything, clear the buffer:
           codeBuffer.clear();

           // If you only parsed one statement and might have more partial code left,
           // you'd remove the parsed portion and keep the remainder.
       }
       // If no semicolon found, just loop back and prompt for more input.
   }
   ```

4. **Incremental Parsing:**
   For a more sophisticated approach, you could do incremental parsing. Each time you get a line, you tokenise it and feed it into the parser. If the parser indicates "incomplete input," you prompt the user for more lines. Once the parser recognizes a complete statement, you execute that statement and proceed. This approach is more complex but gives you finer control.

5. **User Experience:**
   In an interactive SAS session, when you type `data` and press Enter, SAS doesn't immediately error. It waits until a terminating semicolon is encountered. In your interpreter, mimicking this behavior is as simple as not attempting to parse until you detect a semicolon.

**In summary**, the fix is to not treat each line as a full SAS program. Instead, treat input as a stream of tokens. Keep collecting lines until you reach a statement terminator (`;` or `run;`), then parse. If you just have "data" without a semicolon, don't parse yet¡ªjust prompt the user for more input.
