Below is a **more robust** C++ method for **lexing** SAS strings. In SAS, you typically can use **single quotes** or **double quotes** to enclose string literals. Within those literals, **repeated quotes** become an embedded quote. For example:

- `'I''m here'` means **I¡¯m here** (the `''` becomes a single quote in the resulting string).  
- `"She said, ""Yes."""` means **She said, "Yes."**  

The code below **handles**:

1. **Both** single-quoted and double-quoted string literals.  
2. **Doubling** of the quote character to represent an embedded quote.  
3. **End-of-file** check if no matching quote is found (throw error).

(If you need additional features like multiline strings, or macro references inside strings, you can expand this further.)

## 1. Example `scanString` Method

Below is a **function** (e.g., `scanString()`) you could call once you detect your current character is either `'` or `"`. It returns a `Token` of type `STRING`, with `token.text` set to the unescaped string content.

```cpp
Token Lexer::scanString() {
    Token token;
    token.line = line;
    token.col = col;

    // Check which quote char we have: single or double
    char quoteChar = getChar(); // consume the initial quote
    // We already advanced pos by 1, col by 1

    // We'll store the unescaped string in 'value'
    std::string value;

    // We'll keep reading until we find a matching quoteChar
    // If we see the same quoteChar repeated (e.g. '' or ""), that means
    // an embedded quote, so we consume two quotes and add one to 'value'.
    while (true) {
        if (pos >= input.size()) {
            // Reached end of file/string without closing quote
            throw std::runtime_error("Unterminated string literal");
        }

        char c = peekChar();
        if (c == quoteChar) {
            // Look ahead to see if we have a doubled quote
            if (pos + 1 < input.size() && input[pos + 1] == quoteChar) {
                // It's a doubled quote => consume both, add one to 'value'
                // e.g. '' => '  or  "" => "
                getChar(); // consume first quote
                getChar(); // consume second quote
                col += 2;  // we advanced two chars
                // Add a single quoteChar to 'value'
                value.push_back(quoteChar);
            } else {
                // It's a real closing quote
                getChar(); // consume
                col++;
                break; // end of string
            }
        }
        else {
            // Normal char => add to 'value'
            value.push_back(c);
            getChar(); // consume it
            col++;
        }
    }

    // Build the token
    token.type = TokenType::STRING;
    token.text = value;

    // token.line, token.col were set at start, but col will be advanced now
    // You can adjust if you want the token's col to point to the start or end

    return token;
}
```

### Explanation

1. We read the **initial** quote character (either `'` or `"`).  
2. We **loop** until we see a **matching** quote.  
3. If we see a **double** instance of that quote (e.g. `''` inside single-quoted string, or `""` inside double-quoted string), we consume both but append **one** quote to the resulting `value`.  
4. If we reach **EOF** (i.e., `pos >= input.size()`) before finding the closing quote, we throw **"Unterminated string literal"**.  
5. Finally, we return a `Token{ TokenType::STRING, value, line, col }`.

## 2. Integrate Into `getNextToken()`

Replace your old code that just checked for single quotes `'` with something like:

```cpp
Token Lexer::getNextToken() {
    skipWhitespace();

    // ...
    char c = peekChar();
    if (c == '\'' || c == '"') {
        // We have a string literal
        return scanString(); 
    }

    // ... existing logic for numbers, identifiers, etc.
}
```

**Now** your lexer can handle both `'foo'` or `"foo"`, with repeated quotes inside.

## 3. Example Usage

Given an input snippet like:

```
title "She said, ""Yes."""; 
data test;
x = 'I''m here.';
run;
```

Your lexer logic would:

- For `"She said, ""Yes."""`, produce a **STRING** token with text: `She said, "Yes."`
- For `'I''m here.'`, produce a **STRING** token with text: `I'm here.`

---

## 4. Extensions

- **Multiline strings**: SAS typically doesn't allow multiline string literals (unlike some languages). If you do want them, you'd need logic to handle newlines.  
- **Macro references**: SAS allows `&var` references inside strings, which might be expanded at runtime. If you want that, you parse them as literal text, or do an additional pass to expand macros.  
- **Hex/Binary**: SAS also supports some specialized notations like `x'FF'` or `b'1010'` for hex/binary. You can incorporate those if needed.

---

### Conclusion

By introducing a **`scanString()`** method that can handle both `'` and `"` quotes, and doubling of quotes to represent embedded quotes, you get a **robust** SAS-like string literal lexer. This will capture `'I''m here'` => `I'm here` and `"She said, ""Yes."""` => `She said, "Yes."`.
