For the input "data out; set in; x = 42; if x then output; run;", it is parsed successfully, but how to handle it if they are in several lines.

Thought for a couple of seconds
SAS code is typically not line-sensitive¡ªstatements are generally terminated by semicolons, and blocks often end with a `run;`. This means that whether the code is on a single line or spread across multiple lines, you can treat the input as a continuous stream of tokens. The parser should rely on these syntactic delimiters rather than line breaks.

### Approaches to Handling Multi-line Code

1. **Concatenate All Lines Before Parsing:**
   One straightforward approach is to read the entire input (file or standard input) line by line, concatenate it into one large string, and then run the parser on that combined string. The parser, if it¡¯s based on tokens and not line numbers, will work the same way as with a single line of code.

   **Example:**
   ```cpp
   std::ifstream sasStream(sasFile);
   if (!sasStream.is_open()) {
       logLogger->error("Failed to open SAS file: {}", sasFile);
       return 1;
   }

   std::string code;
   std::string line;
   while (std::getline(sasStream, line)) {
       code += line + "\n";
   }

   // Now parse `code` as a whole.
   runSasCode(code, *logLogger, *lstLogger, false);
   ```

   This method ignores line breaks as far as syntax is concerned. The parser sees the entire SAS program at once.

2. **Incremental Parsing (Less Common for SAS):**
   Another approach is to parse incrementally as you read each line, but this is more complex. You¡¯d need to implement a stateful parser that can handle partial statements at the end of a line, carry over the context to the next line, and continue parsing. This is doable but unnecessary if your grammar and parser are designed to parse from a complete buffer of code.

3. **Relying on SAS Semantics:**
   Since SAS statements generally end with a semicolon and data step blocks usually end with `run;`, you can safely concatenate lines until you encounter a `run;` or the end of the file, then parse that chunk. If you have multiple steps, you might do something like:

   ```cpp
   std::ifstream sasStream(sasFile);
   if (!sasStream.is_open()) {
       logLogger->error("Failed to open SAS file: {}", sasFile);
       return 1;
   }

   std::string code;
   std::string line;
   while (std::getline(sasStream, line)) {
       code += line + "\n";
   }

   // Now `code` may have multiple data steps or procedures.
   // Your parser should be able to handle multiple steps in a single input.
   runSasCode(code, *logLogger, *lstLogger, false);
   ```

### Example

If the user¡¯s input is spread across several lines:

```
data out; 
   set in; 
   x = 42; 
   if x then output; 
run;
```

All lines get concatenated into:

```
data out; 
   set in; 
   x = 42; 
   if x then output; 
run;
```

(Note the internal newlines are irrelevant to the parser if it¡¯s looking for tokens like `data`, `out`, `;`, `if`, `then`, `output`, `run`, etc.)

Your parser, which already knows how to handle the tokens and semicolons, will parse this just as if it were on a single line.

### Conclusion

To handle multi-line input, simply read all lines and concatenate them into a single code buffer before parsing. The parser does not need to distinguish between lines; it should rely on SAS syntax (semicolons, `run;`) to delineate statements. This method simplifies your logic and ensures that multi-line code is treated identically to single-line code.
