Any library will be helpful for my hand-written parser? Like handling string conveniently

Thought about parser libraries and utilities for 6 seconds
Yes, several libraries can make certain aspects of writing a hand-rolled parser in C++ more convenient, especially for string handling and related tasks. While you don¡¯t necessarily need a full parser framework, having good utilities for string manipulation, I/O, and debugging can streamline your development process.

Useful Libraries and Tools:
Boost.StringAlgo:

What it helps with: Trimming, splitting, case conversion, tokenizing, and pattern matching on strings.
Why it¡¯s useful: When writing a lexer or dealing with raw input, you¡¯ll need to handle whitespace, parse identifiers, strip comments, or split on certain delimiters. Boost.StringAlgo provides a rich set of free functions and predicates that can simplify these repetitive operations.
Standard C++17/20 Features:

std::string_view: Offers a lightweight, non-owning view into a string. This can help when parsing substrings without creating too many temporary std::string objects.
std::regex: While not always the fastest solution, std::regex can sometimes be handy for quickly prototyping simple token matching or validating certain lexical patterns. (For performance-critical lexing, you might prefer a manual approach or a dedicated lexer generator, but regex can be useful during development.)
fmt Library (formerly {fmt}):

What it helps with: Formatting and printing error messages, debugging output, and logs.
Why it¡¯s useful: When developing a parser, you¡¯ll spend a lot of time diagnosing issues. With fmt, you can produce well-formatted diagnostics (e.g., showing the line and column of an error and highlighting the offending token) more easily than with printf-style formatting.
Boost.Lexical_Cast or std::from_chars:

What it helps with: Converting tokens (strings) into numeric values (integers, doubles) or other types.
Why it¡¯s useful: Once you extract a numeric literal from the input, you need to convert it from text to a number. std::from_chars (C++17 and up) is a fast, locale-independent way to do this. If you¡¯re using older standards, Boost.Lexical_Cast offers an easy, though sometimes slower, approach.
PEGTL (Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library):

What it helps with: Although this moves beyond mere string handling, PEGTL can aid in building a parser from a PEG-based grammar. You still write your grammar by hand, but PEGTL provides a powerful framework of parsing rules and actions, allowing you to avoid writing low-level lexing and parsing boilerplate.
Why it¡¯s useful: If you find that low-level string handling becomes tedious, PEGTL can structure your parsing logic while still keeping it in C++ and under your direct control.
ICU (International Components for Unicode):

What it helps with: Handling Unicode strings and complex encodings properly.
Why it¡¯s useful: If you need to deal with internationalized input or ensure correct behavior for non-ASCII data, ICU gives you robust tools for normalization, case-insensitivity, and more. This might be overkill if your input is strictly ASCII/UTF-8 and you don¡¯t need advanced text transformations, but it¡¯s good to know about.
Summary:
For basic string manipulation (trimming, splitting, case conversion), Boost.StringAlgo is a great toolbox.
For parsing numbers from strings, consider std::from_chars (modern C++) or Boost.Lexical_Cast.
For clean, readable debugging and error messages, the fmt library is extremely helpful.
If you want to scale beyond ad-hoc parsing toward a more structured approach, consider PEGTL as a middle ground between a hand-written parser and a parser generator.
These libraries won¡¯t implement the SAS grammar for you, but they will make tasks like token extraction, error messaging, and basic data conversion simpler and cleaner in your C++ code.
