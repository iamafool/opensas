Of all the c++ parser generators, which one is the best choice for SAS?

Thought about C++ parser generators for SAS for 6 seconds
When it comes to choosing a parser generator for a language as large and complex as SAS, there isn¡¯t a one-size-fits-all ¡°best¡± solution. Each tool has its strengths and trade-offs. However, given SAS¡¯s complexity, you¡¯ll likely want a solution that:

Supports Complex Grammars Gracefully:
SAS is a large language with numerous statements, procedures, macro language constructs, and data step features. A generator that can handle large and intricate grammars, and produce clear error messages and support for modularization, will save you time.

Is Well-Documented and Widely Used:
Good documentation, active communities, and broad usage can help when you run into issues or need guidance.

Integrates Smoothly with C++:
Since you¡¯re writing the interpreter in C++, you¡¯ll want a tool with good C++ support or a clean C++ target.

Common Options
1. ANTLR (with the C++ Target):

Pros:
Robust, Modern Grammar Language: ANTLR¡¯s grammar syntax is well-designed, easy to read, and supports complex language features (e.g., lexical modes, syntactic predicates).
Excellent Tooling and Community: ANTLR has extensive documentation, a large user base, and plenty of tutorials.
C++ Runtime Support: While originally Java-centric, ANTLR4 supports generating parsers in multiple languages, including C++.
Good Error Handling: ANTLR provides hooks for error recovery and reporting, which helps given the complexity of SAS.
Cons:
Build Complexity: Integrating the ANTLR toolchain (which is Java-based) into a pure C++ build system can add complexity.
Runtime Overhead: The C++ runtime is stable but may not be as mature as the Java runtime.
2. Bison (and Flex):

Pros:
Mature, Time-Tested Tools: Bison and Flex are very stable, widely used in parsing complex languages for decades.
Straight C/C++ Integration: They were designed for C/C++ from the ground up, making build integration straightforward.
Large Ecosystem and Documentation: Lots of existing knowledge, examples, and community expertise.
Cons:
Grammar Language Less Expressive: Bison¡¯s grammar syntax is more traditional and may be more cumbersome for a language as large as SAS.
Error Handling and Maintenance: While Bison is powerful, handling complex error scenarios and large grammars can become tricky. You also have to manage a separate lexer (Flex) and integrate them carefully.
3. Other Parser Generators (e.g., Ragel, Spirit.X3 as a generator-like approach, etc.):

PEG-based Generators (like PEGTL): PEGTL is not exactly a ¡°generator¡± but a library. It doesn¡¯t generate code from a grammar file; you write rules directly in C++. While this can be powerful and flexible, it¡¯s less of a generator and more of a framework. If you want a formal grammar file that you compile to a parser, PEGTL isn¡¯t your best fit.
Smaller or Less-Known Generators: Tools like Grammatica, Hermes, or custom DSL frameworks might lack the community and tool maturity you need.
Recommendation
Given the complexity of SAS, ANTLR4 with the C++ target is often the most modern and feature-rich choice. It provides a clean grammar language that can help you keep your SAS grammar organized and maintainable. While integrating ANTLR¡¯s Java-based tool into your build is an extra step, the benefit of having a well-structured grammar, rich tooling (such as ANTLRWorks for debugging grammars), and strong community support can outweigh the initial setup complexity.

In summary:

If you value a modern grammar syntax, good tooling, and a large support community, ANTLR4 with the C++ target is likely your best bet.
If you prefer a purely C-based toolchain and are comfortable with a more traditional parsing approach, Bison/Flex is a classic, reliable choice but might be more tedious for a massive grammar.
For a project of SAS¡¯s scale and complexity, I¡¯d lean towards ANTLR4.
