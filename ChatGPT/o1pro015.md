For Data step and proc step, SAS always show "real time           ?? seconds\n" and "cpu time            ?? seconds");". I need to measure the time spent for each proc and data step. Could please use the standard library chrono to implent this feature? Any decent ways to handle it? If a class will be helpful, please design it and show me the detail code.
