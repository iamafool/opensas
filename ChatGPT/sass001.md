Question: I want to write a console application for SAS. It's like REPL, so I can type in the SAS code, then interpret it, eval it and run it. 
ChatGPT: Thought about SAS console application for 7 seconds
SAS, as a proprietary analytics platform, doesn’t provide a built-in, interactive REPL in the same manner as languages like Python or R. Typically, SAS code is either run in batch mode via command line calls or within the SAS environment (SAS Display Manager, SAS Enterprise Guide, or SAS Studio). However, it is possible to create a custom, REPL-like console application that interprets and executes SAS code snippets by leveraging one of the following approaches:

1. Using the SAS Command-Line Interface in Batch Mode
If you have local access to a SAS installation and a SAS license, you can invoke the sas executable from your operating system’s command line. You can simulate a REPL by:

Create a loop that:

Reads a line of input from the user.
Writes that SAS code into a temporary file (e.g., temp.sas).
Calls sas in batch mode (e.g., sas temp.sas -log temp.log -print temp.lst) to run the code.
Captures the output and displays it back to the user.
Pros/Cons:

Pros: Straightforward to implement if you have a local SAS installation.
Cons: This isn’t truly interactive because SAS still runs in batch mode. Each code snippet runs as a separate job, which may be slow, and you’ll have to parse outputs from .log and .lst files.
Example (Pseudo-Code):

bash
Copy code
while true; do
  echo -n "SAS> "
  read USER_CODE

  # Check for exit conditions
  if [ "$USER_CODE" = "quit" ] || [ "$USER_CODE" = "exit" ]; then
    break
  fi

  # Write code to a temp file
  echo "$USER_CODE" > temp.sas

  # Run SAS in batch mode
  sas temp.sas -log temp.log -print temp.lst

  # Display the log and output to the user
  echo "Log:"
  cat temp.log
  echo "Output:"
  cat temp.lst
done
This approach works, but is somewhat clunky.

2. Using SASPy (Integration with Python)
A more seamless interactive experience can be achieved if you integrate SAS with a Python environment. SASPy is a Python package developed by SAS that allows you to connect to a SAS session (locally or remotely) and submit SAS code from Python, retrieving results in Python objects. You can build a Python-based console REPL that reads user input, sends it to a SAS session through SASPy, and returns the log and results interactively.

High-level Steps:

Install SASPy: This requires that you have SAS installed somewhere accessible and that you configure sascfg.py so SASPy knows how to connect.
Create a SAS session:
python
Copy code
import saspy
sas = saspy.SASsession()
REPL loop:
python
Copy code
while True:
    code = input("SAS> ")
    if code.strip() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        break
    # Submit the SAS code
    results = sas.submit(code)
    # Print log and output
    print("Log:\n", results['LOG'])
    print("Output:\n", results['LST'])
This gives you a much more responsive and “live” environment for testing SAS code. The turnaround time is usually faster than writing out to files and calling SAS directly. Plus, you can parse and handle the results in a more structured way.

Pros/Cons:

Pros: More interactive feel, easier parsing of results, can integrate with other Python-based tooling.
Cons: Requires Python and SASPy setup, still dependent on a SAS backend.
3. Using SAS Viya or SAS9 with Integration Technologies
If you have SAS Viya or SAS 9 and the Integration Technologies, you can establish an IOM (Integrated Object Model) connection programmatically from a language like Java or .NET. Then, you can write a console-based tool that sends SAS code to the SAS Workspace Server and retrieves the results. This can be done by:

Set up the IOM connection to a SAS Workspace Server.
In a loop:
Take user input.
Submit the code using the IOM APIs.
Retrieve the log/output.
Display them in the console.
Pros/Cons:

Pros: Tight integration with SAS in an enterprise environment.
Cons: Requires IOM environment setup, more complex configuration, and possibly licensing constraints.
4. Limitations and Considerations
Licensing and Installation: Any approach that runs actual SAS code requires a licensed SAS environment somewhere. Without it, you cannot truly “run” SAS code.
Performance: Since SAS typically initializes a session for each execution when run batch-style, you might get performance overhead. Solutions like SASPy maintain a live session, reducing overhead.
Interactivity: SAS was not originally designed as an interactive REPL language. What you create will be a workaround or simulation rather than a true interpreter in the style of Python or R.
In summary, the most practical approach to building a REPL-like console for SAS is either to use SAS in batch mode for each code snippet or, more elegantly, to use SASPy and Python. This latter approach maintains a live SAS session and allows you to submit SAS code on the fly, making the experience far closer to an interactive shell.
