Question: I want to start from scratch and write a SAS interpreter using C++.

Thought about building SAS interpreter in C++ for a few seconds
Building a SAS interpreter from scratch in C++ is a highly nontrivial project. The SAS language is large and multi-faceted, encompassing data step logic, a vast library of procedures (PROCs), macro language functionality, extensive data management and I/O features, and built-in statistical, mathematical, and graphical capabilities. SAS is not just a language; it’s an entire analytics environment. Replicating or interpreting it from scratch will be a massive undertaking.

That said, you can attempt to build a simplified subset of SAS features as a starting point. Below is a high-level roadmap and considerations to guide you if you decide to move forward with this project.

Key Considerations
Language Specification:
SAS does not have a fully open and formally specified grammar available publicly. The best you have are the SAS documentation and guides. You will have to:

Derive a grammar by analyzing SAS reference manuals.
Identify a subset of SAS code you want to support. For example, start with basic DATA step syntax and a few simple PROCs.
Understand that certain parts of SAS (like macros, ODS system, or certain PROCs) might be extremely hard to replicate.
Scope and Subset: The SAS environment is huge. A pragmatic approach:

Phase 1: Parse and evaluate simple DATA step code. This involves reading data sets (you may simulate them with simple CSV files), manipulating variables, conditionals, loops, and outputting results.
Phase 2: Implement a small subset of commonly used PROCs (like PROC MEANS or PROC SORT) as functions within your interpreter.
Phase 3: Add macro processing if desired (though macros are essentially a language within a language and will greatly complicate parsing and evaluation).
Without narrowing scope, the project is likely intractable.

Parser and Lexer:

Start by writing a lexer (tokenizer) to convert SAS code into tokens (identifiers, keywords, strings, numbers, operators).
Next, implement a parser that uses these tokens to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Since there is no official grammar file, you’ll rely on the SAS Language Reference documents. Identify the productions for DATA steps, assignment statements, IF/THEN logic, and variable definitions.
Tools: You could write the lexer and parser by hand, or use a parser generator like ANTLR or a C++-oriented library such as PEGTL. However, for a complex, proprietary language like SAS, a hand-rolled parser might end up giving you more control.
AST and Semantic Analysis: Once you have an AST, you need to perform semantic checks:

Variable name resolution.
Type checking (SAS types are relatively straightforward: numeric and character, but with nuances in formats, lengths, etc.).
Ensuring references to datasets, columns, and library references are valid.
This step can be complicated due to SAS-specific semantics, such as implied variable creation and automatic arrays, informats, formats, etc.

Intermediate Representation (IR): After semantic analysis, you may want to translate the AST into an internal representation that is easier to interpret. This could be a set of instructions or a tree-walk interpreter that executes node by node.

Execution Engine: To execute SAS code, you must:

Maintain a symbol table of variables, arrays, and datasets.
Implement the logic of the DATA step execution model (iterative row-by-row processing).
Handle reading input data sets and writing output data sets.
For procedures, you’ll have to implement their logic manually. For example, PROC SORT would require you to:

Extract the dataset from memory.
Sort it based on specified BY variables.
Output the sorted dataset.
Data Handling: SAS primarily deals with datasets in its own internal formats. You will need:

A data structure to represent SAS tables: rows of observations and columns of variables.
A system for handling missing values and numeric/character distinctions.
Ability to read from and write to at least one common file format (CSV or a custom binary format).
Emulating true SAS datasets (SAS7BDAT) is complex. Consider using a simpler format for your initial implementation.

Macro Facility (Advanced): Macros in SAS are a powerful textual pre-processing system. They run before the DATA step code is compiled. If you want macros:

Implement a macro expansion phase that runs on the raw code before parsing.
Keep a macro symbol table separate from data step variables.
Support macro functions, parameters, and conditional logic.
This can drastically increase complexity. It might be best to skip macros until you have a working interpreter for basic DATA step code.

Testing and Validation:

Write small SAS programs and compare the output of your interpreter to the output of actual SAS.
Start with simple examples: reading a small dataset, computing a new variable, filtering rows, etc.
Gradually test more complex language features.
Performance: Interpreting SAS code might be slow compared to a compiled environment. Initially, focus on correctness rather than performance. Once you have a working interpreter, you can consider optimizations.

Example Skeleton in C++ (Very High-Level)
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "Lexer.h"
#include "Parser.h"
#include "AST.h"
#include "Interpreter.h"
#include "DataEnvironment.h"

int main() {
    // A simple REPL
    DataEnvironment dataEnv;
    Interpreter interpreter(dataEnv);

    std::string line;
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "SAS> ";
        if(!std::getline(std::cin, line)) break;
        if(line == "exit" || line == "quit") break;

        // Lexing
        Lexer lexer(line);
        auto tokens = lexer.tokenize();

        // Parsing
        Parser parser(tokens);
        auto ast = parser.parse(); // returns an AST node representing the statement

        // Interpretation
        interpreter.execute(ast);

        // Possibly print results or logs
    }

    return 0;
}
This example is purely conceptual. Each class (Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, etc.) would be a significant undertaking.

Final Thoughts
Feasibility: Implementing a complete SAS interpreter is a project likely spanning years of work, given the complexity of the SAS language and ecosystem. It’s not just another scripting language—SAS integrates data management, statistical routines, macro processing, and a unique execution model.

Better Approaches: Unless you have a strong reason to replicate SAS functionality exactly, consider:

Integrating with SAS through official APIs (like SASPy, IOM connections).
Using an open-source language for data processing (R, Python) and adding SAS-like syntactic sugar.
Focusing on a small subset of SAS features that you absolutely need.
If you are determined, start small: implement a barebones DATA step parser and interpreter, handle simple variable assignments and IF statements, and work upward from there.
